## NOTE
The official NintendoSpy repo is here: 
https://github.com/jaburns/NintendoSpy

This repo contains a few modifications that might (?) perform better with high latency polling. If your Nintendo Spy viewer seems to be siezing up from time to time, you can try this one out, but otherwise I'd recommend the official repository.
